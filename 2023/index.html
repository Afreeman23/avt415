        <p> I have a personal vendetta against George mason university parking services. Students should not have to pay to park on campus. It already costs an arm and a leg to attend this school; why add on parking permits that are 300+? That said, I would hack their website, remove my $75 ticket, and lower the parking permit prices to $1.50.  </p>
